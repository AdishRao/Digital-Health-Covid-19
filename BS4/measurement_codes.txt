84484 		:	   Under Chemistry ProceduresThe lab analyst performs the technical lab test typically using serum, plasma, or whole blood to quantitate troponin. Troponin is a protein labs commonly measure to verify a myocardial infarction and monitor its aftermath.
80053 		:	   Under Organ or Disease Oriented PanelsThe lab analyst performs a comprehensive metabolic panel, or CMP test in which he measures the blood level of 14 chemicals the code descriptor lists for the panel. 
82947 		:	   Under Chemistry ProceduresThe lab analyst performs a test to measure the amount of glucose in a patient's blood using a method other than a reagent strip.
85027 		:	   Under Hematology and Coagulation ProceduresThe lab analyst performs a blood count on the red and white blood cells and platelets also known as thrombocytes. He also determines the hemoglobin, typically by spectrophotometry, and the hematocrit, or packed red cell volume, by calculation in a whole blood sample.
85610 		:	   Under Hematology and Coagulation ProceduresProthrombin time is most commonly measured using the blood plasma. Chemicals like calcium and tissue factor are added to the plasma sample and then the time is noted when the plasma clots. To analyze if a blood thinner agent or an anticoagulant drug like Coumadin is working, the drug is mixed in blood plasma or the patient is instructed to take the medicine before the test. The anticoagulant drug, when properly acting, causes a delay in clotting of blood.
85379 		:	   Under Hematology and Coagulation ProceduresThe lab analyst performs a test using patient plasma to measure the level of D–dimer in the specimen. 
80076 		:	   Under Organ or Disease Oriented PanelsThe lab analyst performs a hepatic function panel test in which he measures the blood levels of total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, both total and direct, and liver enzymes.
83036 		:	   Under Chemistry ProceduresSugar in the bloodstream can get attached to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. Once the sugar is attached, it stays there for the lifetime of the red blood cell (around 120 days or over 3 months). The higher the amount of blood sugar, the more the quantity of sugar attached to the blood cells. This A1C test measures the amount of sugar sticking to the red blood cells, displaying the result as a percentage. This gives the physician an understanding about the blood sugar level of the patient for the preceding three months. A normal, healthy person should have A1C level below 7%.  
80048 		:	   Under Organ or Disease Oriented PanelsThe lab analyst performs a basic metabolic pane (BMP) test in which he measures the blood level of eight chemicals including total calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine.
81001 		:	   Under Urinalysis ProceduresUrinalysis is used to detect substances or cellular material in the urine associated with different metabolic and kidney disorders. It is used to detect urinary tract infections (UTI) and other disorders of the urinary tract. A regular urinalysis often includes color, clarity, odor, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, nitrites, WBC, and ketones. The most common method is dipstick or tablet reagent urinalysis but it can be performed by some other methods as well.
85025 		:	   Under Hematology and Coagulation ProceduresA complete blood count (better known as a CBC) is a blood test request by a doctor that provides detailed information about various types of cells in a patient's blood. Usually a pathologist or a technician conducts the test and provides the results of CBC to the requesting doctor. The blood is drawn from the patient's vein using a syringe and is stored in a test tube containing an anticoagulant (usually EDTA or citrate) to prevent clotting and transported to laboratory.  Nowadays, most often, the cell counting process is done in an automated way using an instrument known as an "automated analyzer". The automatic cell counter counts the number of different cells in the blood and the results are printed out for review by the physician.
84100 		:	   Under Chemistry ProceduresThe lab analyst performs a test to evaluate the level of phosphate, which is phosphorus not contained in biological compounds, in a patient specimen such as serum.

85730 		:	   Under Hematology and Coagulation ProceduresThe analyst performs the technical lab test using plasma or whole blood to measure partial thromboplastin time, PTT, also called APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time. The PTT assay can help diagnose bleeding disorders and monitor anticoagulant therapy.

82962 		:	   Under Chemistry ProceduresBlood glucose monitoring at home with small electronic devices is an easy method to check blood sugar level on a daily basis. The patient himself can perform the procedure and the result is obtained instantly. This method is also known as the "fingerstick method." Remember that blood glucose monitoring at home is done using FDA–approved devices.

82248 		:	   Under Chemistry ProceduresThe lab analyst measures the amount of direct bilirubin in a patient’s blood. Bilirubin is the yellow color pigment found in the bile, a fluid made by the liver. Direct bilirubin is a water soluble form of bilirubin, or one which can dissolve in water. Production of direct bilirubin is a final step in a complex sequence of actions that occurs as the body rids itself of the waste product of the old red blood cells.
81003 		:	   Under Urinalysis ProceduresThe lab analyst inserts a dip stick into a freshly collected urine specimen, removes the dipstick, and shakes off the excess urine. She places the stick onto a mechanical dip stick reader that will automatically read and record the chemical analytes and other constituents such as leukocytes, pH, and specific gravity.
87635 		:	   Under Infectious Agent Antigen DetectionUsing an amplified nucleic acid probe technique, the lab analyst performs the necessary steps to identify the nucleic acids from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–COV–2) virus ), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19).
